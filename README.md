# Hi there!

I'm Abolfazl, and I'm a very creative person. I started building my own businesses when I was very young, and I've always been interested in finding new ways to make people's lives easier.

I've been programming since 2015, and since then, I've been selling Telegram bots and small websites.

In 2019, I started as an Android and iOS developer at René Knipshild. In addition to this work, I programmed small apps privately as a hobby and published them in Google Play. In a short time, I could get more than 100k installations for my apps! That's when I decided to develop games.

That's how the idea for BotStation came up—to set up a game development company where we can build on our experience as app developers by creating both games and blockchain apps that people love using!

In 2021, blockchain became much more interesting for me since it has become the trend of NFTs—and that's where my interest really picked up again. Since then, I've worked on several projects as a blockchain app developer; most recently with [company name].

All these achievements led me to found one of the first Web3 companies in Germany; now we're helping other companies grow
